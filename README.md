# Basic REST API
This project implements a basic REST API with three entity types: Users, Libraries, and Books. Users can register or login using Auth0. New users are added to the database of users. Users can create, edit, and delete books and libraries, and view all books (but not all libraries). 

This is a work in progress, as most endpoints are not yet set up to redirect to a webpage but rather return JSON data. In addition, some functionality is not yet set up (for example, libraries are associated with users, but a library that a user creates is not yet associated with that user entity). 

Updates, and perhaps hosting at a new domain, to come!

This project was a part of CS493 Cloud Application Development at Oregon State University.
